In this project I use the [CIA Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/) database explore summary statistics of all countries on earth. Some questions I will try to answer from the data are the following:
* Countries the smallest/largest population
* Countries with largest growth rate
* Average population per geographic area
* Top 5 countries with largest water to land ratio
* Top 5 countries with higher death than birth rates
